# 📸 Image to Text (OCR) Web Application

In this project, we developed a web application for **image to text** (OCR - Optical Character Recognition) using Python and Streamlit. Users can upload an image and automatically extract the text within it. This project leverages powerful tools like Pytesseract and OpenCV for image processing and text recognition.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Recognize and extract text from images.
- **Web Application:** Build an easy-to-use web interface with Streamlit.
- **Visualization:** Display uploaded images and show the extracted text to users.

## 🚀 Features
- Users can upload images and perform OCR on them.
- Extracted text is displayed in a table format.
- Supports multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, JPEG).
- Simple and user-friendly web interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**: The project is built using Python.
- **Streamlit**: Used for creating the web interface.
- **Pytesseract**: Used for extracting text from images.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing.
- **Pandas**: Used to display the extracted text in a table format.

## 📝 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
